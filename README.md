### JARVIS - Crypto Address Management Bot

If you have ever sent or received crypto payments, you might know that crypto addresses are long and complex. They are basically a combination of hexadecimal characters. If you make even a small error in the address, you will loose your funds forever. Hence it is important to manage those addresses. For this one solution is to use ENS, that maps complex addresses to readable names however setting up ENS will cost you some money. Therefore a free solution is to use a discord bot which can store all our coin-address pairs. If you have to request funds from someone, simply add them to your discord server and tell them to use some simple set of commands to get your BTC,ETH,BAT etc. etc. coin address.
